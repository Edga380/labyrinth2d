# Labyrinth2d
I decided to do a labyrinth game because I thouth it's going to be easy game to start working on.
First I found out how to use <canvas> and draw lines and circles on the screen.
Second I had to code collision detection that was a bit tricky because I wanted it to work on the line that isn't just horizontal or vertical.
After doing that I made start, game, lose and win pages, 10 unique labyrinths.
