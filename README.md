# Labyrinth2d

## Idea:
After developing Bubble Space Wars I decided to do something different so I had this idea to do a simple game using html/css/javascript and add it to my website that I was developing too.

## Planning:

1. Draw a player.
2. Add event listeners to move the player.
3. Draw a map.
4. Make player react to the walls.
5. Make start, lose and win pages.

## Building:

1.

## Debugging:
